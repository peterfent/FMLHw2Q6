This is (non-working) code for Problem 6 on HW 2 of Fundamental Machine Learning. Please take a look and consider some points. I put in a lot of effort into understanding the problem and such but ultimately due to inexperience I was unsuccessful.

The data is split into training and testing data in scale.py. Both of these are written to separate files in a format that is understandable to the libsvm library, as indicated by the documentation. The gender is changed from "M," "F," or "I" to integers, namely "1, -1, 0" respectively. For the classification, any bird with a category under 10 is labelled with a +1, while any 10 or greater is labelled with a -1. Finally, the scaling is done with respect to a lower bound of zero, computed based on the training data and then applied to both the training data and the test data.

My version of either the libsvm was out of date or my version of scipy was too up to date, and so I was unable to get libsvm to work quite correctly. Nonetheless, I wrote what I believe to be okay code to complete this task. This issue holds for C.4 and C.5 of course. As I come from a theory background, I find implementing these techniques very difficult, though I am sure with more time I could figure it out.
